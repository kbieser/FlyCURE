# FlyCURE Manual

## Introduction to genetics research with _Drosophila melanogaster_

### Objectives

We will spend most of the lab time this semester analyzing a novel mutation (MUTANT) that affects the control of cell growth in _Drosophila melanogaster_. This project will introduce you to important techniques in classical and molecular genetics. We begin this week by learning the basics of fly phenotypes.

1.	Describe the _Drosophila_ life cycle.
2.	Understand the basics of fly husbandry.
3.	Distinguish between phenotypes in _Drosophila_.

#### Terms to know:
- _Drosophila melanogaster_
- Stock
- Cross
- Homozygote
- Heterozygote
- Balancer chromosome
- Parental Generation (P)
- First Filial Generation (F1)
- Phenotype
- Genotype
- Mutation
- Apoptosis

## Part 1: Understanding basic _Drosophila melanogaster_ phenotypes

### **Goal:**
Become familiar with 3 stocks of _Drosophila_ to observe basic phenotypes. We will be observing progeny (F1’s) from crosses between these stocks (P’s) of flies in a subsequent lab.

### **Procedure:**
The laboratory bench has 3 vials of _Drosophila melanogaster_. Within these three vials you should be able to identify the following phenotypes listed. One vial contains the control fly, a second vial contains the mutant fly (identical genotype to the control except for the EMS mutation), and the third vial contains a fly we will use for the genetic screen to visualize the mutant phenotype. Utilize the microscope phone adaptor to take pictures with a smart phone to accurately record these phenotypes. Label your photos or take notes so that you can identify these photos later. You will need to reference these throughout the semester.

#### Phenotypes to observe and record

1.	Straight wings
2.	Curly wings
3.	White eyes
4.	Red eyes
5.	Male
6.	Female

#### Write the genotype of each stock of flies you are observing. Be sure to include notes about their phenotypes.

### **Data:**
By the end of lab today, use CamScanner to take pictures and upload the pages with questions from your lab manual for week 1 to the assignment link in canvas as a pdf.
Before lab next week, create the following figure (be sure to include a descriptive figure caption/legend, text, and title) and upload to canvas before lecture. For help with what these mean, see your Handbook for Writing in Biology (pgs. 67-70). This should be the only figure submitted. Use a figure panel to include all images required within a single figure.
