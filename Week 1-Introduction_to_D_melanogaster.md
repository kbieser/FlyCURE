# FlyCURE Manual

## Introduction to genetics research with _Drosophila melanogaster_

### Objectives

We will spend much of the lab time this semester analyzing a novel mutation (O.2.2) that affects the control of cell growth in _Drosophila melanogaster_. This project will introduce you to important techniques in classical and molecular genetics. We begin this week by learning the basics of fly phenotypes.

1.	Describe the _Drosophila_ life cycle.
2.	Understand the basics of fly husbandry.
3.	Distinguish between phenotypes in _Drosophila_.

#### Terms to know:
- _Drosophila melanogaster_
- Stock
- Cross
- Homozygote
- Heterozygote
- Balancer chromosome
- Parental Generation (P)
- First Filial Generation (F1)
- Phenotype
- Genotype
- Mutation
- Apoptosis

## Part 1: Understanding basic _Drosophila melanogaster_ phenotypes

### **Goal:**
Become familiar with 3 stocks of _Drosophila_ to observe basic phenotypes in mutant and control flies. We will be observing progeny (F1’s) from crosses between these stocks (P’s) of flies in week 2.

### **Procedure:**
You will visualize 3 different stocks of Drosophila melanogaster that have 3 different genotypes. Your goal is to view and visualize each of the phenotypes listed below in one or more of the fly stocks. Not all fly stocks will have all of these phenotypes. One stock is the control fly, a second stock is the mutant fly (identical genotype to the control except for the EMS mutation), and the third stock contains a fly we will use for the genetic screen in week 2. Each of these flies have already been photographed for you. You will need to take notes and create a figure that you will submit for this week’s lab. You will reference these figures and images throughout the semester.  

#### Phenotypes to observe and record

1.	Straight wings
2.	Curly wings
3.	White eyes
4.	Red eyes
5.	Male
6.	Female

#### Write the genotype of each stock of flies you are observing. Be sure to include notes about their phenotypes.

### **Data:**
By the end of lab today, use your OneNote Notebook to take notes and answer questions directly in this document. 

- **Figure 1:**
Before laboratory next week, create the following figure (be sure to include a descriptive figure caption/legend, text, and title) and upload to canvas before lecture. For help with what these mean, see your Handbook for Writing in Biology (pgs. 67-70). This should be the only figure submitted.
