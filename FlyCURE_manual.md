# FlyCURE Manual

## Week 1: Introduction to genetics research with _Drosophila melanogaster_

### Week 1: Objectives

We will spend most of the lab time this semester analyzing a novel mutation (MUTANT) that affects the control of cell growth in _Drosophila melanogaster_. This project will introduce you to important techniques in classical and molecular genetics. We begin this week by learning the basics of fly phenotypes.

1.	Describe the _Drosophila_ life cycle.
2.	Understand the basics of fly husbandry.
3.	Distinguish between phenotypes in _Drosophila_.
