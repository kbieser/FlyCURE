## Week 3: Complementation mapping

This week, we will examine the progeny of the complementation mapping crosses to determine where our mutation maps on chromosome arm 2R.  

### Objectives

1. Understand how complementation mapping may be used to determine if two mutations affect the same gene.
2. Examine and interpret data from complementation mapping.

#### Terms to know:
- _Drosophila melanogaster_
- Balancer chromosome

- Failure to complement
- Deficiency Mapping
- Parental Generation (P)
- First Filial Generation (F1)
- Punnett Square
- Homozygous lethality

## **Introduction**

### **Complementation Mapping**
The complementation mapping crosses were set up prior to this week's lab:  

            _Virgin ♀ FRT42D, Ark82, O.2.2/CyO_   X  _♂ Df(2R)/balancer_

  where all the deficiency stocks were maintained as heterozygotes with balancer chromosomes that carry the _CyO_ mutant allele.  

### **Procedure:**

#### Background

_Make phenotypic predictions of each deficiency cross in the complementation test._

Using the Punnett Square below, predict the inheritance of the second chromosome: (_*note this cross represents a generic cross between this particular mutant and a deficiency stock on chromosome 2R_)

  _♀;FRT42D,ark82,EMS Mutation/CyO    X  ♂;Df(2R)/CyO_



  What phenotypic ratios based on the above cross would you see if the mutation and the deficiency: (hint: the ratio’s will be different for each scenario and each on it's own should add to 1)

  complement?

  fail to complement?




### **Procedure:**
**_Scoring the progeny of each deficiency cross_**

Approximately 86 crosses have been set-up. Each vial represents a cross between virgin females of the EMS mutation (O.2.2) mated to males of a particular deficiency (#0-85). These crosses will be divided among the groups so that each cross is examined once. Score each of the deficiency crosses using the following steps:

**Note, this is the procedure for in person labs. If conducting mapping virtually, view the digital images of each of the crosses provided to you. All data collected should be entered into the google spreadsheet.**

1. Take one of the cross vials, and record the deficiency stock code (i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc. on the fly vial) and the deficiency stock number (282, 442, etc.) in the google sheet for your group/class.

2. Empty the progeny onto the stage of your dissecting microscope. You should remove most of the flies, but don’t worry about getting every last fly out.  

3. Using a paintbrush to manipulate the flies, examine each individual fly. For each fly, determine if the fly has straight wings or curly wings. Remember that the Cy allele has variable expressivity, so you may have to examine the flies carefully if the wings are not obviously curled upwards. If a fly’s wing is torn or otherwise damaged in such a way that you can’t tell its wing shape, simply don’t count it.  

4. Record the number of flies of each phenotype on the google spreadsheet.  

5. Return the flies to the vial.  

6. Repeat with additional vials until all the crosses have been scored. Each cross only needs to be scored once.  

**_Determining the breakpoints in each deficiency stock_**
7. Go to the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center webpage at http://bdsc.indiana.edu/.  

8. Enter the stock number into the search box and hit the “Submit” key.

9. At the top of the search result you should see the stock number. Next to this number should be the stock’s genotype. Below this top line is a table titled “Components and genes”. You may have to click on the arrow below the stock number to expand the entry to see the table.  

10. In the “Components and genes” section, find the entry for the deficiency in your stock, which will have the general form Df(2R)… . Record the name of this deficiency in the “Genotype” column of the Excel spreadsheet.  

11. At the bottom of this entry you may find the sequence coordinates for the deficiency, which are given in the format 2R:x;2R:y, where x and y are the the first and last bases that are deleted in this deficiency. Enter the number x in the Breakpoint 1 column, and the number y in the Breakpoint 2 column. This will allow easy sorting later. Make sure you enter ONLY the coordinates – if your entry doesn’t look like a number, Excel won’t sort it as a number. If x and/or y are given as a range (e.g. 10002..10015), give the smaller number in the range for x, and the larger number in the range for y.  

12. If the coordinates for your deficiency aren’t given in this entry, click on the deficiency’s link. This will take you to an entry on the Flybase database. Find the sequence coordinates in the entry and record them on your Excel spreadsheet.  

### Answer the following questions:

  1. What do these two break points represent?


  2. What information is learned from a cross between our mutant and a deficiency stock that complement? Fails to complement?

  Table 1: Identify all crosses that failed to complement (Only use for combined Class Data; you may not use all rows)

  | Df # |  Stock Number |  Genotype  |   Chromosomal Break 1 |   Chromosomal Break 2


  3. Identify the smallest region of overlap among all of the above deficiencies.


  4. What does this region represent?

13. Design an experiment to further map this mutant to a smaller region on chromosome 2R using further complementation mapping.

a. Utilize the genomic browser (http://flybase.org/cgi-bin/gbrowse2/dmel/)

    i. Type in the coordinates for the region of failure to complement in the format “2R:first number..second number”. (Make sure you enter the two periods between the coordinates.)

    ii. Under the tabs at the top of the browser click “select tracks”. At the top, under the “Reference Genome Annotations” section, select the “Gene Span” track. Then scroll down to the “Aberrations” section, and click to select the “Stock Center Aberration: deleted segment” track. Make sure that all other tracks are unchecked. Then click on the “Back to browser” button. The browser will now show any other deficiencies in the region that are available for mapping.

    iii. Identify deficiencies (the general name of each deficiency will be Df (2R) BSC #, where # is a number) that you would like to use to conduct future complementation mapping experiments. You may not have to select every deficiency in the region, but do make sure that you select a set of deficiencies that will map your mutation to the smallest possible genomic region.  

    iv. Click on the name of each selected deficiency. This will open up a new tab in your browser with the Flybase entry for the deficiency. Enter the chromosomal breakpoints for the deficiency in the google sheet “addn def” tab.  

    v. Scroll down on the entry and click the “+” button next to “Stocks” to expand the entry. Enter the Bloomington stock number and genotype of the available deficiency stock in the table.  

    vi. I will order these stocks to set-up additional crosses to further map our mutant.  

### **Data:**
By the end of lab today, use your OneNote Notebook to take notes and answer questions directly in this document.

**Figure 1:**
Before laboratory next week, create the following figure (be sure to include a descriptive figure caption/legend, text, and title) and upload to canvas before lecture. For help with what these mean, see your Handbook for Writing in Biology (pgs. 67-70). This should be the only figure submitted.

Figure 1: A depiction of the region on chromosome 2 that failed to complement your mutant (Using images from Flybase’s genomic browser is acceptable as long as they are properly cited and saved using a printable format – utilize print screen and not pictures taken of screen from phone).
